       - Contains all filter elements and controls
       - Classes: 'filter-container', 'filter-section'

    2. FILTER HEADER
       - Title/label identifying this as the filter section
       - May include icon or clear button
       - Shows active filter count if applicable

    3. FILTER DROPDOWNS
       Multiple dropdown select elements for different filter criteria:

          - ID: filter-department or similar

    4. ACTIVE FILTERS DISPLAY
       - Shows which filters are currently applied
       - Displays as badges or chips with remove buttons
       - Updates dynamically when filters change
       - Shows total results count

    5. FILTER ACTIONS
       - "Apply Filters" button: Trigger filter application (if not real-time)

       - "Reset" button: Alternative to clear all selections

  ATTRIBUTES & DATA:
    - data-filter-type: Identifies which filter this element controls
    - data-filter-value: The value selected for this filter
    - aria-label: Accessibility label for filter elements
    - disabled: Disable options that would return no results (optional)

  CSS CLASSES USED:
    - .filter-container: Main wrapper
    - .filter-group: Individual filter control group
    - .filter-dropdown: Select element styling
    - .filter-option: Individual option in dropdown
    - .active-filters: Container for showing applied filters

    - .filter-button: Buttons for apply/clear/reset
    - .filter-results: Shows matching results count

  INTERACTIONS:
    - User selects option from dropdown
    - JavaScript listens for 'change' event
    - Filters are applied (real-time or on button click)
    - Active filters displayed and can be removed individually
    - Results update to show only matching items

  ACCESSIBILITY:
    - Proper labels for each filter (for accessibility)
    - ARIA attributes for screen readers
    - Keyboard navigation support
    - Focus states for all interactive elements

  RESPONSIVE DESIGN:
    - Mobile: Dropdowns stack vertically or use select-based layouts
    - Tablet: Side-by-side layout with proper spacing
    - Desktop: Horizontal layout with maximum width constraints

  NOTES:
    - Structure keeps HTML semantic and clean
    - JavaScript handles all dynamic behavior
    - CSS handles all styling and responsive layout
    - Filters should be independent and work in combination
    - Default state shows "All" or "Any" option for each filter
